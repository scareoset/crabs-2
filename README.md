## synopsis

the general concept of *crab clicker* is:
> idle/incremental games explore the limits of infinite growth and tend to result in cosmic endgames
what if, instead of building up into space exploration, there was a game that explored the depths of the oceans? my gut instinct is to play with carcinization as a theme. the deeper you go, the more things have evolved into a crab form. the more you delve, the more ***you*** become crab-like.

## stages of play

most idle/incremental games have multiple stages of play with unique goals and/or mechanics. *crab clicker* is broken into three main stages, which are outlined below.

### crab enthusiast

in this stage, you are just trying to make your number of crabs grow. the two main resources you will be tracking are **number of crabs** and **space for crabs**. i'm still fuzzy on the details about how you gain and spend resources, but am leaning toward adding some sort of currency as a third major resource. though games such as *Cookie Clicker* do not worry about money; you just click to make more cookies. maybe it can be that simple. click to buy a crab from the pet store. :3

the end of this stage will be the reveal of a larger system: the **crab classification** system. this is inspired by the term "true crab," which is used to identify members of the Brachyura infraorder. decapods (crustaceans) in the Anomura infraorder are often called "{name} crab" but are not considered true crabs. both infraorders are in the Meiura clade. 

in gameplay, this will look like a new statistic becoming visible: **crab affinity**. true crabs will have a higher crab affinity than members of Anomura, but no crab has 100% crab affinity. this will lead the player to begin collecting resources in order to prepare for a crab expedition. this undersea undertaking will help the player collect more information about crabs (through lore entries) and get closer to ascending to crab-hood themself. once the player has collected enough resources and built their submersible exploration craft, they set sail for stage two.

### crab preservationist

in this stage, you are documenting crab species and collecting specimens. the more species you find, the more information and lore you will uncover. your crab knowledge will deepen (~~and your personal crab affinity will tick up~~). while your **number of crabs** and **space for crabs** are still counted, the more important resource is going to be some sort of unique **crab currency** (maybe counting shells? data entries?).

### crab ascension

this is the stage where you are actively trying to commune with an ancient crustcean deity. you will begin to augment your physical form with crab-like modifications, undergoing a self-imposed carcinization process. as your now-visible personal **crab affinity** approaches "acceptable levels," you will begin to hear the voices of the (crab) god(s). at a certain point, they will ask you if you wish to ascend. at first, your only option is to accept. this sends you back to **stage one** with a permanent buff to your (premanently visible **crab affinity**, which will allow you to play through the stages faster and discover more divine crab species, unlocking even more lore.

your **crab affinity** should not increase quickly. it should take ages for it to move up a percentage point. this is by designâ€”the end of the entire game will see your **crab affinity** accelerate towards total crab (the full crab, if you will).
